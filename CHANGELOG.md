## v0.1.5

### Changes

#### Attributes

Soldier:  
  
- Air Strike: Add 25% clip size penalty
- Air Strike: Decrease rocket clip size bonus from up to +1 rocket from +2 rockets

The airstrike was found to go from being undertuned to overtuned. In order to reduce its effectiveness, starting rockets have been reduced.

 
- Black Box: Add 10% damage vs buildings

The Black Box serves as a good denial of area weapon, but still feels too generally ineffective in versatility. It now is now more effective in nest busting by an increase in damage vs buildings

Demo:  
- Quickiebomb Launcher: Add auto-fire on full clip penalty

The quickiebomb became a force to be reckoned with using the new faster fire interval. As such, the quickiebomb launcher auto fires on full loading now in order to take away from the level of control the demo has.


Heavy:  
- Huo Long Heater: Decrease projectile deviation by 33% (from 3 to 2)
- Huo Long Heater: Decrease projectile speed penalty from 33% to 25%
- Huo Long Heater: Decrease fire rate penalty from 75% to 40%  


The Huo Long once again felt unfulfilling compared to its counterparts. This weapon has had some boons to its behavior to compensate once more.


#### Bugfixes

- Correct Crusader Crossbow attributes to be reverted to single-bolt clip


## v0.1.4

### Changes

#### Attributes

Multi-Class:

- Panic Attack: Remove 75% reload rate penalty  
- Panic Attack: Decrease clip size penalty from 50% to 33%  

The Panic Attack downsides were considered too harsh and unfun to use in any capacity. The reload penalty has been entirely removed and the clip size penalty reduced.

The weapon will retain it's reload rate bonus while healed--since this intentionally counteracts the fact that healing a hurt targets is going to reduce the fire rate of this weapon--thus making this upside a situationally double edged sword.
  
Soldier:  
  
- Direct Hit: Decrease clip size penalty from 50% to 25%  

The clip size penalty on the direct hit was found to be too harsh. Rocket jumping allowed for a single rocket--which, even if successfully impacted, took too much setup for limited benefit.
  
- Air Strike: Remove 50% clip size penalty  
- Air Strike: Decrease rocket clip size bonus from up to +4 rockets down to +2 rockets  
  
The Air Strike, like the Direct Hit, also suffered from a punishing clip size. Clip size has been promoted to 4, with the ability of 6 rockets cap still being the maximum.

- Black Box: Decrease projectile speed penalty from -60% to -33%

The Black Box seems well in concept, but the rockets feel a bit too slow. Reducing the move speed penalty slightly
  
Pyro:  
  
- Backburner: Reduce airblast refire penalty from 100% to 50%
- Backburner: Remove speed boost on airblast allies
- Backburner: Add airblast pulls targets towards the ground

The airblast penalty, while necessary, felt overtuned, and has been reduced to be more forgiving.

The speed boost on allies has been switched for pulling targets to the ground from the Degreaser. The reasoning here is that pulling towards to the ground is more beneficial to a weapon that can get a damage bonus from bouncing flame particles.
  
- Degreaser: Remove airblast pulls targets towards the ground
- Degreaser: Add speed boost on airblast allies
- Degreaser: Add +50% faster airblast refire rate
- Degreaser: Add +50% more pushback on airblast
- Degreaser: 25% ammo consumed penalty increase to 300% ammo consumed

The Degreaser was found to be generally unfun and ineffective. Therefore, the weapon has been reworked to promote the use of airblast. Airblasting allies now provides speed boost and pushes enemies further.

Ammo consumption on the primary fire is significantly increased to discourage wasteful flaming. Airblast reflects should be tactfully used to generate more ammo for the Pyro in the fight to compensate for increased ammo consumption.
  
- Axtinguisher: Change Minicrit on burning target to full crits vs burning targets  
- Axtinguisher: Add 50% fire rate penalty  

The Axtinguisher using minicrits was unpunishing and this wanted to be re-introduced. With a fire rate penalty, the initial swing is important--as missing costs a significant amount of time and missed opportunity.
  
- Sharpened Volcano Fragment: Remove Minicrit vs burning targets  
- Sharpened Volcano Fragment: Remove damage penalty
- Sharpened Volcano Fragment: Add +25 HP on wearer
- Sharpened Volcano Fragment: Add -50% from healing penalty

The Sharpened Volcano Fragment's original concept was uninteresting and was changed to take over the old Powerjack.

- Powerjack: Remove +25 HP on wearer
- Powerjack: Remove -50% from healing penalty
- Powerjack: Add significant downward force on hit
- Powerjack: Add 20% deploy speed bonus
- Powerjack: Add 66% damage penalty

The powerjack attributes were transferred to the Sharpened Volcano Fragment. The Powerjack itself now works more like an actual hammer in terms of behavior.

Demo:  
  
- Iron Bomber: Remove 30% reload penalty  
- Iron Bomber: Decrease projectile deviation by 33% (from 3 to 2)  

Reloading took too long, making this impractical to use in any combat situationl. The projectile deviation was also very harsh, making it too unreliable.
  
- Tide Turner: Reduce ammo clip size penalty from -100% clip size penality to -90% clip size penalty

This allows the wearer limited primary fire rate capacity and the ability to pick up ammo boxes.
  
- Quickiebomb Launcher: Reduce charge rate by 10% (85% to 95% reduction)
- Quickiebomb LauncheR: Reduce penalty on max stickies out to -6 from -7 (allows for one extra sticky)

The Quickiebomb downsides felt too extreme for its burst fire capacity. Fire rate has been increased as well as maximum stickies out to allow for stickies to travel the full distance
  
Heavy:  
- Huo Long Heater: Decrease projection deviation by 40% (from 5 to 3)  
- Huo Long Heater: Decrease projectile speed penalty from 50% to 33%  
- Huo Long Heater: Decrease fire rate penalty from 75% to 60%  
  
The Huo Long Heater, while fun, seemed a little undertuned compared to its counterparts. The biggest complaint was its cone. The cone has been reduced by 40%. Projectile speed has also been increased slightly, with a slight increase in fire rate as well. 
 
Engineer:  
  
- Rescue Ranger: Remove 25% reload penalty  
- Rescue Ranger: Remove 50% clip size penalty  
- Rescue Ranger: Remove Mark for Death on building pickup
- Rescue Ranger: Remove 50% damage penalty vs players
- Rescue Ranger: Add 20% reload rate bonus

While burst healing is a great upside to have, the downsides to not being able to repair on the ready were too harsh. The Rescue Ranger has been sped up to compensate for this. Damage vs players was also buffed for being undertuned.
  
- Eureka Effect: Decrease building build rate penalty from 40% to 20%
  
Medic:  
  
- Blutsauger: Remove Mad Milk Syringes  

The Blutsauger having both ubercharge and mad milk syringes offered a lot for a marginal downside. Mad Milk Syringes have been removed in favor of only ubercharge gain.
  
- Crusader's Crossbow: Revert clip size and firing mechanics to default  
- Crusader's Crossbow: Increase healing done to buildings  

Due to a bug in building healing being fixed, buildings can now be healed by a standard crossbow bolt. The Crossbow's other effects have been reverted to normal play.
  
Spy:  

- Your Eternal Reward: Remove .5 second cloak penalty

The Your Eternal Reward, while a good concept, felt too heavily punished on both ends of cloaking. Cloaking speed is no longer reduced
  
- Conniver's Kunai: All attributes disabled due to various bugs in weapon behavior

Due to various bugs and behavior, the Kunai concept has been scrapped and is pending a re-design.

- Spy-cicle: Remove afterburn immunity and no burning while disguised
- Spy-cicle: Increase damage resistance to 33% up from 20%

While interesting in concept, the Spy-cicle proved too powerful and completely eliminated the counterplay of Pyro. The Spycicle will retain a damage bonus that is slightly higher, but will once again allow Spies to be ignited by Pyro.

#### Whitelist changes:
- Mad milk: Added to blacklist

#### Bugfixes

- Remove Lollichop from weapon blacklist
- Re-implement self-healing on quick-fix ubercharge
- Correct Southern Hospitality metal gain attribute listing (says +40, should be +30)
